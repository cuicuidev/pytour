A unique approach to pathfinding that attempts to solve the travelling salesman problem with a distance constraint.

### Problem definition
Given a weighted graph, find the optimal path between nodes A and B, where A can be equal to B. A path is considered optimal when the sum of its nodes' biases
is the highest among all valid paths. A valid path is a path that meets all the constraining criteria.
